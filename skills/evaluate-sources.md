# Skill: Source Evaluation

Assess the credibility and reliability of sources found during research.

## When to Use

Apply this skill when you need to determine how much to trust a source, especially for controversial topics, technical claims, or data-heavy research.

## Instructions

For each source, evaluate on these dimensions:

1. **Authority** — Who published this? Is the author/organization a recognized expert?
2. **Currency** — When was it published or last updated? Is the information still relevant?
3. **Accuracy** — Can the claims be verified? Do other sources corroborate this?
4. **Purpose** — Is this informational, commercial, persuasive, or opinion? What biases might exist?
5. **Coverage** — Does it cover the topic thoroughly or only partially?

## Output Format

```markdown
### Source: [Title](URL)
- **Authority**: High / Medium / Low — <reasoning>
- **Currency**: <publication date> — Current / Dated / Unknown
- **Accuracy**: Verified / Partially Verified / Unverified
- **Purpose**: Informational / Commercial / Opinion / Mixed
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive / Partial / Narrow
- **Overall Reliability**: High / Medium / Low
- **Notes**: <any caveats>
